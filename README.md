## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Solution URL: [solution here](https://github.com/gp0710/stats-preview-card)
- Live Site URL: [live site here](https://gp0710.github.io/stats-preview-card/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was determined to use a "mobile-first" workflow mindset for this project. Through netninja's youtube videos, I learned to cut down on repetitive CSS using variables. Categorizing my selectors based on the below made my code simpler and easier to understand: 

```
/* variables */
/* reset */
/* base styles */
/* fonts */
/* mobile styles */

```

I learned CSS grid in conjunction for use with flexbox. 

### Continued development

Unfortunately, this project is not optimized for tablet. It's best viewed on a phone (min-width: 375px) or Desktop (min-width: 1000px). Perhaps I may optimize this for tablet in the future.

### Useful resources

- [TheNetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-bUGxoSYco&ab_channel=TheNetNinja) - Super helpful youtube playlist to learn good CSS practices and building mobile responsive sites!
- [w3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - I don't know what I'd do without w3 schools. It's just a useful source to reference to when I'm not sure about what declarations and values to use for CSS.
